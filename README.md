The **C drive (C:)** is the main hard disk partition which contains the operating system and the related system files. In Windows operating systems, the C drive as represented as “C:\”, the backlash representing the root directory of the drive.

The C drive is considered as the primary hard drive of the system and is used for storing the operating system, system files and other applications and their related files.

In later Windows version, the C: drive is labeled as Primary Drive or Local Disk, and can be accessed by default by opening the **“My Computer”** folder.

## Partitioning C Drive (C:)

As the hard disks were smaller compared to today’s, a single letter assignment was all what was needed. Most of the time, the operating system resides on the C drive.

However, today it is possible for the C drive to refer to a smaller portion of the larger disk that also has several other drive letters. The other letters may refer to additional partitions of the same storage disk. This is done to keep the operating system partition protected from infected data, or to ensure better scalability.

In case of hardware or operating system upgrades, the C: partition can be formatted without affecting the data in other partitions. It is also useful to avoid filling the OS partition completely, causing the system to crash or stop working as intended.

The C: partition should always be protected against the most serious cyberthreats. Hackers, viruses and spyware often target the C drive as it is the default drive for installation of the operating system.

## How Do I Find the C Drive On My Computer?

You can find the C drive from within the Windows file explorer by navigating to This PC. To do this, either search for This PC in the Windows search bar, or press Windows key+E and select This PC from the left-hand menu.

On older versions of Windows, you want to look for My Computer instead.

From the This PC window you should be able to see all of your Windows PC's drives, including the C drive.

## Why Is It Called the C Drive?

The letter naming scheme for Windows still leans on its DOS legacy, where the A and B letterings were reserved for floppy disk drives since most computers at the time had a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, and a 5.25-inch floppy drive (some didn't have a hard drive at all). The C drive has, since then, been reserved for the main operating system drive and its important system files even though floppy drives have slid into obsolescence.
